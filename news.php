<h3 style='color:blue;font-size:16px;'>Russell blitz leads shaky KKR to win</h3>
<img src="img/russel.jpg"  class="img-thumbnail">
<p style="font-size:18px; color:black;">In a repeat of last seasonâ€™s final, defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders
 got the better of hosts Kings XI Punjab by six wickets at the MCA International Stadium in Pune. 
 Set to chase 156, KKR were reduced to 60 for 5 in the eighth over and were all but out of the contest, 
 but fought back through a spectacular innings from Andre Russell and his 95-run partnership with Yusuf Pathan.

<img src="img/duminy.jpg"  class="img-thumbnail">
<p style="color:black;font-size:18";>
JP Duminy's all-round brilliance set the foundation of Delhi Daredevils'
 second win of the season 
 but it still took remarkable presence of mind from Mayank Agarwal to close the doors on Sunrisers Hyderabad.
 The home team needed seven runs off the last two balls when Karn Sharma's slice was headed over the rope behind point,
 but Agarwal leapt and parried the ball back into play to deny Sunrisers four runs.
 That save more or less sealed the result.

<p style="color:black;font-size:18";>
In-form batsmen aplenty. Bowlers not lacking in resilience. 
And captains who might well be cricket whisperers. 
Chennai Super Kings against Rajasthan Royals, on current form, is the contest of the IPL and the best
 case for the drawing board to gather dust. 
 If only to keep from being reminded of the opposition's strengths.

</h3>
<img src="img/unbeaten.jpg"  class="img-thumbnail">
<p style="color:black;font-size:18";>
Kieron Pollard and Rohit Sharma did their best to help Mumbai Indians set a challenging target 
for Chennai Super Kings, but a whirlwind opening partnership between Dwayne Smith and Brendon McCullum
 made a mockery of a 184-run chase. The six-wicket win at the Wankhede Stadium was Super Kings'
 third in as many games, even as their opponents 
 suffered their fourth consecutive loss of the season.

<h3 style='color:blue;font-size:16px;'>The McCullum mystery in the IPL Continues</h3>
<img src="img/mccullum.jpg"  class="img-thumbnail">
<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">Brendon McCullum has started the 2015 IPL in fine style, 
but his numbers in the previous seven seasons aren't consistent
with his obvious attacking skills and talent
 McCullum seems to have carried that form into the IPL, for in his second innings of this tournament 
 he carted the bowlers from Sunrisers Hyderabad all over Chepauk in scoring an unbeaten 100 off 56 balls.

Royals clinch fourth win after close chase</h3>
<img src="img/royals.jpg"  class="img-thumbnail">
<p style="font-size:18px;">
Late drama turned a one-sided canter into a last-ball finish, but Rajasthan Royals, 
the team that had dominated 95% of the contest, won in the end and preserved their perfect record for the season.
